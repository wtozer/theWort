# The mash
## Heat brewing water

Water:grain ratio should be 4 L / kg, heated up to 71C.  Make more than needed.  At this ratio, 71C initial temperature will go to 67C with the grain.

## Preheat the tun

Preheat the cooler with about 4L of boiling water.  Swirl around the cooler and pour it back into the sparge pot.

## Mash-in

Add water to the grain, not the other way around.  Do this about 4L at a time.

If you pour the water in at once, it could "thermally shock" the enzymes.

Stir thoroughly to make sure that the grains are all wet, but don't aerate it.

## Check the temperature

Should be 67C (range: 65 - 68).  Adjust with hot or cold water, but don't exceed 69C.

## Monitor

Stir mash every 15-20 minutes.

Temperature can drop by up to 5C over an hour.  If temperature drops below 62C within 1/2 hour, add more water to bring temperature back up.

## Heat the sparge water

Heat about 13L of sparge water to about 73-80C.

Let the mash go for an hour...
