# 2013.02.22  Triple wort with Wade and Rich #

## Yorkshire bitter ##
* Muntons connoisseurs yorkshire bitter
* Morgans master lager pale malt extract
* 15g Fuggles dry hops (Coppertun)
* Kit yeast

### Tasting notes:

* **Rich**: nice and easy drinking.  Could have been a bit more bitter
  and hoppy, but a good session beer.

## ESB extra special stout (big purple can) ##

comes with safale s04 dry ale yeast (english ale yeast)
yeast pitched at 27deg (should have been max 24)

### Tasting notes:

* **Rich**: despite good online reviews for this kit, a little
  disappointed with the beer, as it feels like it should have had a
  bit more body.  Definitely improving with age though (at 6 weeks
  after bottling).

| O.G.       |  1.042-1.046 (10.5-11.5) |
| E.G.       | 1.010-1.014 (2.5-3.5)    |
| Bitterness | 30 IBU                   |
| Colour     | 15 SRM (30 EBC)          |

Prepare the toasted malt as described in the Pahlaha India Pale Ale recipe.

Add the cracked crystal malt and cracked toasted barley to 1.5 gal (5.7L) cold water and steep at 150-160F (65-71C) for 30 minutes.  Remove the bag/grains with a strainer.

Add the malt extract and Northern Brewer hops and boil for 60 minutes.  Add the aroma hops during the final 1 minute of boiling.  Strain and ???spurge??? the wort into 2 gallons (7.5L) of cold water in the fermenter.  Top off with additional water to make 5 gallons (19l).  When it cools add ale yeast.

Ferment, bottle and watch the sunset over an Irish Red.

## Tasting notes

* **Rich**: Really impressed by this one.  Nice and malty with enough
  hoppiness to balance it out.  Also improved with age (better 4 weeks
  after bottling).

[Andrea uncovered this site with some good recipes](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/02/best-homebrewing-recipes-how-to-brew-your-own-beer.html)

[Interesting article about local beer production in SMH weekend paper](http://smh.com.au/business/bitter-battles-in-what-looks-to-be-an-ailing-market-20130208-2e3wx.html). 

The plots are most interesting, showing

- long term decline in beer consumption
- that cost of production for a case of beer is about $14, which is about the same as home-brew (but excluding labour). So most of our savings come through avoiding tax and profit margins.
