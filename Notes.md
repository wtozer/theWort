# GENERAL TIPS# #

##STARTER##
If you have wort at less than 1.060 you don't need a starter. Starter is sterile water at 20c with dry malt extract at ratio of 10:1 (water
to extract). Put in sterile container with glad wrap or foil over opening and chuck in wort after a day or two.

## Bulk priming ##

The secondary fermentation that occurs in the bottle to gas the beer is as a result of putting effectively a teaspoon of sugar in each 750ml bottle. A better way to achieve the same result and it also allows you to use different size bottles is to "bulk prime" your brew. This also guards against putting to much sugar in a bottle and getting a exploding bottle. The mess this causes has to be experienced to be believed.

YOU NEED:-A full (30 750ml bottle) brew, a second fermenter with tap, 1.5m of catering grade plastic tubing and a tap adaptor tube, 6g per litre dextrose or sugar. 

WHAT TO DO:- Dissolve the dextrose in 500ml of boiling water and add to the empty fermenter. Connect the hose to your full fermenter using the adaptor tube and put the other end into the second fermenter. Open the tap and drain the upper fermenter into the lower one. Stir then bottle immediately from the second fermenter.
 
Six grams of sugar or dextrose per litre is for medium carbonation. 
 
You can also adjust the level of carbonation in your beers by adding to or removing from the amount of dextrose you use.

## Cleaning Craig's pre-filled vessel ##

To clean craig's vessel:

- fill will capful of unscented napisan, leave to soak
- rinse 3 times
- rinse with sanitiser and close up

## Rack your beer ##

simple step, SIGNIFICANTLY improves flavour and clarity. 
buy a second fermenter and some food-grade hose.
Transfer beer to secondary fermeneter while yest is still active. The best time is when the bubbling in the airlock has subsided to about 2-3 per minute (2-5 days for an ale or 7-15 days for a lager). Makes more difference for a lager which has longer maturation time.

## Use either light dry malt (LDM/LME) or liquid malt extract. ##

The days of 1kg of white sugar are over. The days of Coopers brewing sugar (with sucrose) are over. Depending on your style of beer, I believe 500g LDM is a minimum. 1kg of LDM alone in my beers are almost standard. You are not doing your beer a favour by using dextrose and maltodextrin alone. (will this point be controversial?)  

## Replace the sugar called for in your recipe with malt extract. 
It is possible to calculate the exact amount of malt extract to use, but I simply substitute either dry malt extract or malt extract syrup for the sugar called for in the recipe on a gram for gram basis. Malt extract is more expensive than sugar - but the improvement in taste more than compensates. 

Using light, amber, dark and wheat malts rather the kilo of sugar or dextrose is marginally more expensive, $4-5 a kilo from well-priced retailers, but will have an instant affect on the body and flavour profiles of the beers you make. 
Sugar or dextrose can be used, but try to keep it below the 10-20% limit. Other adjuncts such as honey, golden syrup, molasses and rice malt can also be used. For example, a change to 500 gms of honey and 500 gms of light malt is much better brewing than 1 kg of neat sugar.

## Never use kit yeast. 

If you've been reading any of the many recent posting on this forum, you would already know why. The yeast can be too old, or just simply cheap and nasty. It makes good yeast nutrient though. Safale and saflager are a very good (and inexpensive substitute). Liquid yeasts, whilst more expensive, are well worth the money when it comes to the quality of your beer. Remember, the yeast is the thing that makes your beer! 
Good yeast = good beer. 

##Know your Yeast
When buying a kit beer take the top off and look at the yeast. Look at the type of yeast in the lager and ale kits. See if they are the same. Some vendors package the same yeast with both types of beers. This makes you wonder how 'true to style' these beers could be. The kits that I use come supplied with Safale Lager and Ale yeast. Safale yeasts produces a relatively clean flavour low in esters. Look around for other brands though and avoid the plain white un-marked variety.
The yeast as supplied with your kit is designed to work with some malt and some sugar. Using 1 kg malt instead of sugar often ends up with a sweetish brew. Kits can be improved by using better yeasts. Try Safale in summer and Saflager in winter. The dry yeast supplied with lager kits is usually only ale yeast.  Consider using liquid yeasts. There is a good range of liquid yeasts available. White labs California ale is a good starting point. It's a clean yeast that doesn't contribute extra flavours to your brew. If you are trying to brew to a particular style you will have to use a liquid yeast. $10 per brew is too expensive. See in the Morgans brewers chat how to make a single purchase last for 18 brews by storing in stubbies in the fridge.

##Control your temperature. 

This is probably the most difficult thing to do of all the things I have mentioned. But if you can keep your lagers at 9*C and your ales at 19*C, you will have good beer. 

These are getting a little more difficult now... 


##Do a stove-top boil. 

Save yourself from dancing around the brewing area with a boiling kettle in one hand, a hot can of concentrate in the other, and your thermometer in your third hand, trying to wash the last of the concentrate out of the can, mix in your malt, and hope that the brew is the correct temperature to pitch your yeast. 
Put it all (not the yeast!) into a big pot on the stove, leasurely scrape out the can, gently stir in your malt, sit back and have a beer whilst it heats up. Then when you are ready, add your steeped specialty grain (point 6) and your extra hops (point 7). 
Easy. 


##Use specialty grains. 

Buy yourself a 125g bag of crystal (or whatever). Simply stick it in some hot water, and let it sit. Pour the contents into your boil, or the fermenter (straining out the grain husks). This adds a big new dimension to your beer. BIG. I highly recommend. 


##Add extra hops. 

The simplest way is to buy a "teabag" of hops from any HB store (and even some Big W). Put into a cup of boiling water for a bit, then add to your brew. Dead easy. 


I hope that these few ideas will help some of our newer brewing brothers achieve that quality of beer that their wives etc will live to regret. Remember, if she gave you the gear, she can't complain that you spend too much time/money/effort/space using it. 

The first four points are the most useful to new brewers, and I can almost guarantee that you won't go back to your old methods once you have tasted the difference.

## Boil the mix
Great beers are made from a wort which is boiled for at least an hour with hops. Kits are made from malt extract which has been produced by low temperature vacuum evaporation. Can you see the difference ?

If you need further evidence, do this quick experiment next time you make up a kit beer. Leave a few tablespoons of extract in the bottom of the tin, and pour in a few cups of boiling water. Give it a good stir to dissolve as much as possible and then carefully (use oven mits so that you don't burn yourself) pour it into a saucepan. Boil it for about 10 minutes and then allow it to cool.  You will see a dirty white scum form during boiling, along with brown flakes floating within the liquid (hot break). These come from proteins and parts of the barley plant from which the malt extract was made. (Oh, and by the way, congradulations on just preparing some malt extract for use as a yeast starter!) I don't know about you, but this scum is not the sort of thing that I want in my beer.

To give your beer a cleaner taste, rather than dissolving the kit with hot water and pouring into your fermenter, add it to a large saucepan or stock pot and while stiring carefully, boil it for 10-15 minutes. Cover and allow to cool for 15-30 minutes.
One drawback with this method is that what little hop aroma is present in the kit will be driven off, so you may like to throw in some aroma hops just as you turn off the heat.
When it has settled out, carefully pour the wort off the hot break and hops into your fermenter. Don't worry if any of the gunk makes it into your fermenter as it won't do any harm.


##SANISTISING

(assuming no rinse sanistiser)
While you can get away with using the kitchen sink we suggest that you get a dedicated vessel for the job. A plastic container with internal dimensions of 800x400 and 150 deep (from Howards Storage) is perfect as it can also be used to do your fermenter by rolling it over a few times on its side. 
We also recommend you get a small plastic spray bottle from your local hardware garden centre so you can attack the nasty creatures on surfaces you can’t fit into the sanitising container. 
Brew Day Sanitation
First make sure that everything you use (including your hands and forearms) is washed clean with water and a low-suds detergent. Do not use perfumed detergents as even small amounts can end up in the flavour of your beer. Instead use an easy rinsing detergent like Brewhaus Brewers Detergent. 
Sanitation (killing bacteria) really becomes an issue the moment you turn off your kettle after boiling your wort. 

What you need to do

* Fill your sanitising vessel (special vessel or kitchen sink) with water and sanitiser according to the instructions. Submerge all parts of the fermenter and make sure the tap is open. Roll the cleaned fermenter around many times before assembling it, make sure the tap is closed and place the lid on loosely.
* Sanitise the yeast packet and scissors (or knife) you'll open it with by immersing them in your sanitising solution.
If you are a first time brewer and are following the "dump and run" procedure you should also sanitise your can of extract and thoroughly wash and sanitise the can-opener.
NOTE: If you can't fit your fermenter in your sanitising vessel, firstly sanitise the lid, tap etc. and then pour a couple of litres of sanitiser into the fermenter and shake it with the lid on 

**Bottling Day Sanitation**
Bottling your beer is the probably least enjoyable part of the whole home-brewing process (drinking it is naturally the most enjoyable part) and you will find that kegging significantly reduces the work-load. 
Before handling your finished beer make sure that you have thoroughly washed and sanitised your hands. 
If you are going to bottle (that’s where most of us started) five things will make bottling easier –
 
* A lever operated adjustable height bottle capper.
* A bottle tree.
* A no-rinse sanitiser.
* A bottling cane.
* A small garden spray bottle.

What you need to do

* Wash all the bottles you need (you calculated how many you’ll need – right?) using a non-perfumed brewers detergent and rinse them with clean water.
* Fill your sanitising vessel with water and sanitiser according to the instructions.
* Fill the garden spray bottle with some of the sanitising fluid.
* Place the bottling cane pieces in the sanitiser. Roll the bottle tree around in it for a couple of minutes and place it in a clean sheltered area not far from your fermenter. If you can’t fit your bottle tree in your sanitising vessel you’ll have to fill your spray bottle with sanitiser and douse it by spraying it.
* Submerse all your bottles in the sanitiser for 5 mins making sure no bubbles are in them. Pull the bottles out and place them on the tree to drain.
* Submerse the appropriate number of crown seals in the sanitiser making sure no air bubbles are attached (leave them in there until needed).
* Spray some sanitiser around the bell of the bottle capper.

## Using Beer Finings ##

Beer finings (distinct from kettle finings such as Whirfloc) are added to beer a few days before bottling in order to precipitate proteins out of suspension giving a clearer beer with less chance of "chill haze". In order to be effective they should be employed at least 48 hours prior to bottling. 

**How Are They Used**
You must be very careful even at this stage not to introduce any unwanted infection into your beer so take sanitation very seriously. Wash and sanitise your hands and everything else that is used in this operation. It can be valuable to have a new Chux cloth soaked in sanitiser, squeezed and laid out handy in case you need to put something on a sterile surface. 

* Sanitise your sachet of finings, a spoon, a small glass or stainless steel jug and a clean pair of scissors.
*	Boil some water and pour 250ml into the jug. This is necessary to assist dissolving the finings and to drive all dissolved oxygen out of the water.
*	Open the sachet and dissolve the contents in the boiling water stirring with the spoon as necessary.
*	Dissolve a few teaspoons of sugar or dextrose in the jug. This will cause the yeast to generate a little more CO2 which will drive off any oxygen that gets into your fermenter.
*	With sanitised hands, open your fermenter and gently pour the solution into the beer.
*	Gently stir the top of the beer with the spoon, replace the lid and refit the airlock.

#Cleaning#
Don’t use scourer on plastic –roughens surface and leaves grooves for bacteria.

-	Old toothbrush is good.
-	Buy snap tap which can be pulled apart

Sanitise the following: the can opener, top of tin of malt, scissors that open yeast packet, yeast packet and any scrapers used. 
Products
These products are sodium metabisulphate, bleach, boiling water and neopink. Craftbrewers have a few other products to use such as iodine and TPG. I will not go into the techniques for these products. 
Sodium metabisulphate is used in winemaking and is also used by homebrewers. Some brewers consider that it should stay in the winemakers realm as due to the differences in pH and Alcohol level there is far less margin for error in beer making than winemaking. 
It is known that sodium metabisulphate in wine causes allergic reactions such as asthma. Sodium metabisulphate forms sulphur dioxide gas when dissolved in water. This gas kills bacteria. After about 24 hours the sulphur dioxide has dissipated and the solution will no longer sanitise. Follow the directions on the packaging or dissolve two teaspoons in a litre of cold water. Coat all brewing equipment in the soluion. Allow 10-15 minutes contact time. Do not rinse off. Swish the solution around in your fermenter so that all surfaces are wet, including all threads. Run some solution through the tap. Discard used solution. Camden tablets are a known weight of sodium metabisulphate and used extensively in wine making. As sodium metabisulphate only inhibits rather than eliminates beer spoiling bacteria, brewers should probably look elsewhere for effective sanitisers.
Bleach is cheap and effective. Use unscented household bleach at about 5ml per litre. Put 100 ml of bleach in your cleaned fermenter. Top up with water and allow to soak for 1/2 an hour. Run some of the solution through the tap. Soak all brewing equipment including fermeter lids, seals, grommets, airlock, stirrer etc in another bucket of this solution. After 1/2 an hour rinse off well with plain tapwater or rinse with boiling water. If you feel that you are wasting bleach, make up a solution of a few litres, swish around in the fermenter, wet all brewing equipment, allow the bleach solution 20 minutes contact time then rinse off. Make sure all bleached equipment is rinsed well otherwise bleach causes nasty off flavours in your brew. Do not soak metals in bleach for longer than necessary. I have found no problem in pickling my fermenter for a few days with 100ml bleach in a full to the brim fermenter. Some plastics are degraded by long term contact with bleach solution. Do not pickle rubber bungs, racking tubes etc for longer than an hour or so. High concentrations of bleach will quickly make pale spots on clothing.
Boiling water can be used to sanitise but will not kill all bacteria. Be careful using it on any glass equipment. Thermometers, hydrometers and glass carboys are very sensitive to thermal shock. Do not use boiling water on these items. Do not use boiling water on airlocks, they turn into useless works of art. For heat to effectively kill all bacteria it needs to be at higher than 100 deg C for more than just a few seconds. To kill 100% of bacteria requires boiling at higher than 100deg C for 20 minutes in an autoclave.
Neo-pink is a widely available cleaner and sanitizer. Dissolve 1 teaspoon per litre in hot water, wash items and rinse in cold water. I have never seen any discussion on the effectiveness of this product or to the required contact time for sanitation. I use it for washing my bottles and find it cheap and effective as the bottles do not need 15 minutes contact time. Some brewshops supply it in bulk if you take an empty container in to be filled. It would appear to not require 15 minutes contact time for sanititation. I cannot verify this but I trust what the manufacturer says on the container. This stuff smells a bit and can cause skin reactions. Use gloves when washing up with it.
Brewshield appears to be the answer to the brewers prayers. This is a no rinse sanitiser that leaves no odour. I use this product in a spray bottle and spray the threads of fermenters, brew areas and use it in airlocks. Many brewers use it and find it successful. It can also be used for bottle rinsing.

## Using Hops with Kit Beers ##


Hops were originally used in beer as a preservative. It was not long before it was considered an essential ingredient imparting bitterness & flavour as well as aroma providing a balance for malty sweetness.
Hops are flowers (or cones) that are grown on a grape like vine. The flowers are dried and compressed into pellets, which prolong their shelf life and make them easier to use. There are many different varieties hops which all impart there own characteristic and produce a wide variety of different style beer.
As most of the beer kits available are already bittered, it is the flavour & aroma characteristics we are trying to enhance when using hops in our brew. Below are three different methods you can adopt which all will give slight flavour differences.

*Standard Method:* Place hops in a sterilised vessel (coffee mug will do!) and fill with boiling water. Allow to steep for approximately 10 minutes to release the flavour while you prepare the rest of your brew.
Tip the whole contents of the mug into the fermenter just before you add the yeast & give a gentle stir with a sterilised spoon. Add the yeast!                     Easy!!


*Dry Hop:* Add hops to the fermenter after you have dissolved your other ingredients in hot water. Give a gentle stir to ensure hops are soaked thoroughly, then fill to required level with cold water. Add the yeast!

*Quick Boil:* In a saucepan, dissolve your brewing sugar in approximately 2 litres of water & bring it to a gentle simmer. Toss in the hops & simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. If you intend to use other hops by the standard method, you may use this liquid & saucepan instead of a coffee mug. Ie at the end of the simmer, remove saucepan from heat, toss in other hops & steep for 10 minutes as normal. Using this liquid should reduce the need for further hot water.
