## Gear

Brew bag from Dave's (5kg)
false bottom vessel?

Mini mash possible

## Dave's notes
3 L /kg for mash
4 L /kg for sparge

We'll get some water getting into the grain (so less than 18L will make it through).  Should have about 35L before the boil, but should lose a lot over the course of the boil.
